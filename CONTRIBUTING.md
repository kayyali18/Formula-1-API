# Contributing to this project

### Setup

Before you can contribute to this project, you need to have it pulled down locally. Instructions on getting it setup can be found [here](https://github.com/kayyali18/node-backend-server/README.md).

### Making Commits

When writing commits messages, be explicit and concise as to what is being changed. If you need a lot of text for your commit messages, you should be making smaller, more atomic commits.

Commits should:

- Start with an uppercase word.
- The first word should be a verb in the present tense.
- Keep character count below 72 characters.

Example: `Create new migration adding a championship column to the driver table`

### Pull Requests

- Use the GitHub UI to make pull requests.
- Write tests for new features including for all conditional paths and function calls.
- Make sure all existing tests all pass before making a pull request.
- As with commits, keep all pul requests small and focused.
- Maintain a clean commit history.
- Use style consistent with the rest of the codebase.
- Before submitting a pull request, make sure to merge or rebase work with the master branch.
